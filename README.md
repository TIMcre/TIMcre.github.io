# README

Welcome to my repository for the website code for my movie and TV show recommendation site, created during the Techfestival 2022 hosted by the University of LÃ¼beck.

This website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and makes use of the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework.

The `index.html` file is the homepage for the site, featuring a hero section with a background image and text. The `navbar` at the top of the page allows the user to navigate to the `movies.html` and `shows.html` pages.

The `movies.html` and `shows.html` pages both have a similar structure, featuring a section at the top with a recommended movie or TV show of the week, and a grid of additional recommendations below. When the user clicks the "More" button, additional information about the featured movie or TV show appears. The user can then click the "Close" button to hide this information again.

The `style.css` file contains all of the styles for the site, including the use of the `has-bg-img` class to apply a background image to the hero section on the homepage.

The `main.js` file contains the JavaScript code for the site, including the event listeners for the "More" and "Close" buttons on the `movies.html` and `shows.html` pages.
